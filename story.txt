Once upon a time there was a man named Gauss, who loved Rammstein, cars, and lederhosen. 
He drove his BMW to the nearest biergarten where he stuffed himeself full of bratwurst and became highly inebriated.
The next morning he woke up in the back room of a ratskeller, clothed in a dirndel, his lederhose nowhere in sight.
The musik and wettbewerbsfaehig drinking were a blur, but he knew one thingâ€”he had a craving for Gebaeck.
