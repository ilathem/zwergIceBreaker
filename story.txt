Once upon a time there was a man named Gauss, who loved Rammstein, cars, and lederhosen. 
He drove his BMW to the nearest biergarten where he stuffed himself full of bratwurst and became highly inebriated.
The next morning he woke up in the back room of a ratskeller, clothed in a dirndel, his lederhose nowhere in sight.
The musik and wettbewerbsfaehig drinking were a blur, but he knew one thingâ€”he had a craving for Gebaeck.
He just so happened to spot a very delicious looking gebaeck and went to grab it, but suddenly a large hund snatched it away.
